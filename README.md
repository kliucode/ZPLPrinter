# ZPLPrinter
ZPL Printer Simulator for Android Devices

The ZPLPrinter application listens for ZPL code payload on TCP port 9100. The received payload will be rendered using the Labelary's web service available at http://labelary.com/service.html.

Note: This project was roughly put together. Further optimization needed for better performance and function on Android devices.
